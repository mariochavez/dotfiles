## specs/[date-name]/spec.md

```markdown
# [Feature Name]

## Goal
[One sentence: what this feature enables the user to do]

## User Stories

- As a [user], I want to [action] so that [outcome]
- As a [user], I want to [action] so that [outcome]

## Requirements

### Functional
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]

### Business Rules
- [Rule: e.g., "A provider can have at most 1 appointment per 30-min slot"]

## Visual Design

[Link to mockup OR brief layout description]

Example:
- Page: list of [items] with [columns], filtered by [state]
- Empty state: "[message]"
- Actions: [button labels and what they do]
- On success: redirect to [path], notice "[message]"

## Out of Scope (v1)

- [Thing we're NOT building yet]
- [Another exclusion]
```

---

## specs/[date-name]/references.md

Documents existing code the implementer should follow or reuse. Written during Shape phase.

```markdown
# References: [Feature Name]

## Models to Extend or Follow

- `app/models/appointment.rb` — status pattern (string column + named methods)
- `app/models/concerns/publishable.rb` — concern structure to follow

## Controllers to Follow

- `app/controllers/appointments_controller.rb` — standard CRUD structure, authorization pattern
- `app/controllers/appointments/confirmations_controller.rb` — sub-resource pattern example

## Views / Partials to Reuse

- `app/views/shared/_empty_state.html.erb` — use for empty list states
- `app/views/shared/_status_badge.html.erb` — use for status display

## Stimulus Controllers to Reference

- `app/javascript/controllers/date_picker_controller.js` — value + target pattern to follow

## Notes

[Any other important context about existing code]
```

## specs/[date-name]/standards.md

Created during Shape phase by copying the content of each applicable standard. Makes the spec folder **self-contained** — Claude Code needs nothing outside this folder to implement correctly.

```markdown
# Standards: [Feature Name]

The following standards apply to this feature. Copied from `sdd/standards/` at shape time.

## global/rails-stack

[full content of sdd/standards/global/rails-stack.md]

## specs/[date-name]/tasks.md

Contains the full task breakdown. Each group has a **self-contained Claude Code prompt** — everything an agent needs to execute that group is embedded inline.

```markdown
# Tasks: [Feature Name]

**Spec:** `sdd/specs/[folder]/spec.md`
**Total tests:** ~[N]

---

## Group 1: Database

### Tasks
- [ ] `bin/rails g migration Create[Model] [columns]`
- [ ] Add model validations and associations to `app/models/[model].rb`

### Tests to write first
- [ ] `[Model]Test#test_[scenario]`
- [ ] `[Model]Test#test_[scenario]`

### Verify
`source ~/.zshrc && bin/rails test test/models/[model]_test.rb`
